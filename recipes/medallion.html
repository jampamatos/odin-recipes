    <h2>Medallion</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 filet mignon medallions (150 g each)</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove the filet mignon from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes – it cannot 
            be cold when it goes into the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the medallions with salt and pepper to taste. Heat a skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is very 
            hot, drizzle with olive oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Arrange the two medallions side by side and sear for 
            3 minutes per side – the meat will be golden brown on the outside and rare in the center.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the medallions to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm while you prepare the sauce.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine</li>
        <li>½ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the same skillet where the medallions were browned, add the butter and heat over medium heat. Note: do not wash the skillet; 
            the browned bits from the meat will flavor the sauce. Once melted, add the flour and mix well for 2 minutes to form a paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomato paste and stir for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a spatula to dissolve the browned bits and 
            give the roux a rusty color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the wine and stir to break up any lumps of flour (use a whisk if you prefer). Stir in the boiling water, season with salt and 
            pepper, and cook until the sauce reduces and thickens slightly – this takes about 2 minutes. Check the consistency with a spoon: the 
            sauce should form a shiny layer on the back of the spoon. Serve immediately over the medallions.
        </li>
    </ol>
