    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><strong>Carborana spaghetti</strong> is a traditional italian pasta recipe, that gets its name (<em>carbonara</em> derivates from the italian word for coal) for the black dots formed by black pepper.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g (7 oz) spaghetti pasta;</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced bacon;</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine;</li>
        <li>2 whole eggs;</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks;</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grilled parmesan cheese;</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized pan, boil 2 liters (1/2 gal) of water;</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of salt and the pasta to the boiling water and let it cook until the pasta is <em>al dente</em>;</li>
        <li>In a bowl, add the 2 whole eggs, the 2 egg yolks and the cheese and stir it with a fork.</li>
        <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat and brown the bacon for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat, pour over the white wine, mix well and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, set aside 1 cup of the cooking water.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Nexts steps are to be done quickly</em></strong>: drain the water, transfer the pasta to the pan with the hot bacon, add the eggs and mix well – the heat of the pasta will cook the eggs, forming a cream;</li> 
        <li>Return the pan to the heat very low and gradually add the reserved cooking water, stirring it with a spatula for a few minutes until it forms a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve afterwards with black pepper to taste.</li>

    </ol>
