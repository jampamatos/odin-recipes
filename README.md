# Welcome to Jampa's Cooking Emporium!

## Sit back, relax, eat a lump of cheese!

This is my first ever [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)... well, project.

In this project I'm supposed to start building a Recipe Page (one that I'll probably really use to store my most favorite recipes, good for an amateur cook such as myself).

I will be updating this Readme file stating the project phase, and describing the skills I have put to use in it.

### Steps:

1. So, in the first phase, I'm supposed to create the HTML backbone of the website. To start, I added an index.html page and linked it to my first recipe. Aftewards, I completed the recipe page, and added two other recipes, to a grand total of three.
1. Second phase starts with the creation of a Stylesheet and some very basic styles. I changed the font, the color of the hyperlinks, some link hover changing and image sizing, all through CSS.
1. For the third phase, I started designing the overall look and style of the site, using flexbox and the other great stuff we learned to this point of the course. I aim to put on a header with a logo and the site name in the left side, a dummy search bar and social media links on the right, and the body with a cards like disposition of the content.
