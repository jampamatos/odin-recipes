This is my first ever The Odin Project... well, project.

In this project I'm supposed to start building a Recipe Page (one that I'll probably really use to store my most favorite recipes, good for an amateur cook such as myself).

I will be updating this Readme file stating the project phase, and describing the skills I have put to use in it.

So, in the first phase, I'm supposed to create the HTML backbone of the website.

To start, I added an index.html page and linked it to my first recipe. Aftewards, I completed the recipe page, and added two other recipes, to a grand total of three.
